### Features 
* Navigation Bar

Featured on all 3 pages, the navigation bar has links to the Home page, the Top Artists page and the Music Page. I initially put the nav bar on the right side of the page on desktop view and decided to centre the nav bar on mobile devices.  When clicked on, each link will bring the user to the respective section. I also added a line below the links so they are visible when you hover over them. 

* The Home Page

The page starts with the heading Afrobeat. I also included an Afrobeat image that I downloaded from google, I then poisitioned the image on the left side of the page. I then added some information about Afrobeat on the right side of the page. The information added is just a brief understanding of Afrobeat and the history.
