This is a website for Afrobeat, a music genre which involves the combination of elements of West African musical styles such as fuji music and highlife with American jazz and later soul and funk influences. This website gives a brief understanding of Afrobeat. The site consists of 3 pages, a home page, top artsits page, music page. This website also consits of a footer section.

### Features 
* Navigation Bar

Featured on all 3 pages, the navigation bar has links to the Home page, the Top Artists page and the Music Page. I initially put the nav bar on the right side of the page on desktop view and decided to centre the nav bar on mobile devices.  When clicked on, each link will bring the user to the respective section. I also added a line below the links so they are visible when you hover over them. 

* The Home Page

The page starts with the heading Afrobeat. I also included an Afrobeat image that I downloaded from google, I then poisitioned the image on the left side of the page. I then added some information about Afrobeat on the right side of the page. The information added is just a brief understanding of Afrobeat and the history.

* Top Artists Page

The heading and nav bar is kept the same to keep the same feel as the main page ensuring familiarity for the user through all pages. This page features images of some top afrobeat artists. This page gives the user an idea of who the top artsits are as I included their names below their images, I aslo inlcuded links to their names so you will be redirected to either their website or wikipedia when clicked on. This will give you al lot more information about the artists as well as other afrobeat artists. I had to take a screenshot of the images from the artists Instagram pages.

* Music Page

Again, the heading and nav bar is kept the same to keep the same feel as the main page ensuring familiarity for the user . On this page I emebeded videos from youtube just so the users can watch and listen to a few afrobeat songs. This will also give you an oportunity to click on the youtube link where you will find more afrobeat songs.

* Footer section

The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Afrobeat. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.
